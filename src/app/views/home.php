            <h2 class="text-center">Welcome to the Option Trading Simulator</h2>
            <p class='text-center'>We are in the early stages of design and development, which are 
                happening concurrently. We'll have most of the site wire-framed
                by the end of March, 2014, with basic functionality expected by 
                end of Summer. I want one of these and can't find a free one on
                the Internet, so I thought I'd write one. Stay tuned...</p>
